# AVR 7-Segment Display Driver

This project demonstrates how to control a common-anode 3-digit 7-segment display using an ATmega microcontroller. It cycles digits 0â€“9 across three digits with multiplexing.

The project is for embedded systems learners who want to practice bit manipulation, port configuration, and timing control on AVR microcontrollers.

Iâ€™m Abdulrasheed Olumide, a passionate embedded systems and desktop application developer, working on blending C/C++ system-level programming with real hardware control.

## âš¡ How to Run
Requirements

AVR Microcontroller (e.g., ATmega16/32/328P)

avr-gcc (compiler)

avrdude (flashing tool)

USBasp or Arduino-as-ISP programmer

A 3-digit common anode 7-segment display with current-limiting resistors

Build and Flash

Compile the code

avr-gcc -mmcu=atmega328p -DF_CPU=16000000UL -Os -o main.elf main.c


Generate HEX file

avr-objcopy -O ihex -R .eeprom main.elf main.hex


Flash to MCU (USBasp example)

avrdude -c usbasp -p m328p -U flash:w:main.hex
